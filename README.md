# FitaraNaiveBayes and RNN
This project involves building Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether the dataset contains document which is classified into whether the document belongs to fitara or not

Using Naive Bayes one needs to use app.py. App.py will generate nb.pickle and cv.pickle.Pickling is done so that the model is trained once and prediction could be made.

For using RNN use Serverchi.py
It will load mymodel.h5 in your local machine.oad the model and then you can predict.
